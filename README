This is KURT, the Keen Utility for Rewriting Trees.

Implemented by Alex Rudnick (http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~alexr) as part of a phd
qualifiers project.

KURT is a Python 3 library for experimenting with xT tree transducers, which
take in trees and produce other trees; they're described more fully in the
lovely article by Graehl et al [0].

KURT uses some code from NLTK version 3.4 (http://nltk.org), but just the minimally
required parts to make Tree objects work. It is the requirements file.


For usage examples, please see src/spanish.py, german.py, and pokemon.py !
